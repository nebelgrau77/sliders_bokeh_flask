### ideas

_First view_: 6 sliders for the KPIs, one menu to choose "dealer". Choosing the dealer sets the sliders into the positions of this dealer's KPIs, and the chart shows the score.
Moving the sliders changes the score. Needs a RESET button to show the original value, or show the original value and the new value (better).

_Second view_: as above, but with all the details, not single KPIs.
